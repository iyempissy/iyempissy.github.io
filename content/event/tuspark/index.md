summary: 'Elevating User Feedback: Exploring NLP\'s Impact on Review Helpfulness Prediction.'
abstract: 'Mining sensitive data such as health data can lead to faster medical decisions, improvement in the
quality of treatment, disease prevention and innovative solutions. However, health data is highly
sensitive and subject to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which
aims to ensure patient privacy. Anonymization or removal of patient identifiable information,
though the most conventional way, is the first important step to adhere to the regulations and
incorporate privacy concerns. Nonetheless, anonymization alone is not sufficient.
In this first part of the talk, we will see a reconstruction attack on anonymized data that can retrieve
the original private data with a high accuracy.
Similarly, when machine learning models are trained on sensitive data, the released model can still
leak information on the data it was trained on.
In the second part of the talk, we will discuss membership inference attack on graph neural networks
(GNNs) where the goal of the adversary is to determine whether a particular data was used in
training the target model.'
