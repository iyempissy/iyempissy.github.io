Emmanuel is a doctoral candiate in his final year at L3S Research Center, Leibniz university Hannover under the supervision of Prof. [Wolfgang Nejdl](https://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/) and Asst. Prof. [Megha Khosla](https://khosla.github.io/). He is deeply passionate about the privacy of machine learning models, with a specialization in graph neural networks. Emmanuel excels in identifying vulnerabilities in machine learning models by lauching attacks and developing defenses, with a particular focus on the strategic implementation of differential privacy techniques to foster a more secure, responsible and ethical AI. He was a visiting researcher in the [Multimedia Computing Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing) at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). In his free time, he provides consultancy services on data / ML model privacy.
<!-- His research focuses on safeguarding user privacy while harnessing the potential of machine learning algorithms.  -->
