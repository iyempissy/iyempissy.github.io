**Emmanuel** is a postdoctoral researcher in the [TruX](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/research-groups/trux/) research group at [SnT](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/), University of Luxembourg, working with [Tegawendé Bissyande](https://bissyande.github.io/) and [Jacques Klein](https://jacquesklein2302.github.io/). His research focuses on the security and privacy of large language models (LLMs) for trustworthy software.

Previously, he was a postdoc at CISPA in the [SprintML lab](https://sprintml.com), collaborating with [Adam Dziedzic](https://adam-dziedzic.com/) and [Franziska Boenisch](https://franziska-boenisch.de/) on LLM privacy.

He earned his PhD from [Leibniz Universität Hannover (LUH)](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/) under [Wolfgang Nejdl](https://www.kbs.uni-hannover.de/~nejdl/) and Asst. Prof. [Megha Khosla](https://khosla.github.io/), focusing on privacy of graph neural networks (GNNs). He was affiliated with the [L3S Research Center](https://www.l3s.de/), [Leibniz AI lab](https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/), and was a visiting researcher at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/).

His work centers on identifying vulnerabilities in machine learning models and developing defenses to promote secure and ethical AI. 
<!-- In his free time, he provides consultancy services on data / ML model privacy. -->
